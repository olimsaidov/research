# Business Logic Complexity Analysis

## Overview

The business logic complexity of the Jarima platform evolved from simple CRUD operations to a sophisticated orchestration of multiple interconnected systems, AI-powered decision engines, and real-time data processing pipelines. This analysis examines how the platform's core business logic grew in sophistication while maintaining reliability, security, and performance. The complexity evolution demonstrates the challenges of scaling government systems while preserving accuracy, fairness, and legal compliance.
