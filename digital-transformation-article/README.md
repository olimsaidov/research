## Article Details

**Title**: Digital Transformation of Traffic Enforcement: A Seven-Year Longitudinal Study of Citizen Engagement

**Authors**: 
- Olim Orifovich Saidov (PhD candidate) - olimosaidov@gmail.com
- Dr. Orif Qudratovich Makhmanov, D.Sc. (Supervisor) - orif.mahmanov@gmail.com

**Affiliation**: Muhammad al-Khwarizmi Tashkent University of Information Technologies, Tashkent, Uzbekistan

**Abstract**: This study examines how digital transformation through crowdsourced civic technology revolutionizes traditional government services, using traffic enforcement as a critical case. We investigate the evolution of citizen engagement in the E-Jarima platform, a pioneering crowdsourced traffic violation reporting system in Uzbekistan.

## Key Findings

The research provides longitudinal evidence spanning seven years (2019-2025) of the E-Jarima platform's evolution, demonstrating:

- **2,564% growth** in citizen participation (33,383 violations in 2019 to 531,924 in 2024)
- **95.7% payment compliance** versus 40% in traditional enforcement
- **77% cost reduction** in operational expenses
- **150-200 lives saved annually** through improved traffic safety
